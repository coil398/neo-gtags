GNU global is a brilliant work, however in my environment, it does not work properly for some reason on both debian 9 and ubuntu 16.04 even thought it works on mac os.
In addition, GNU global does not support other nice languages such as python, ruby, and so on without a troublesome process like installing pygments? and exuberant-ctags? forget it.

In this work, I or We are trying to seek for a alternative tag system for vim or another editor? It needs to be easier ,more user-friendly and opened to users.
